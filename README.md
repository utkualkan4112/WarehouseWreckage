# WarehouseWreckage

WarehouseWreckage is my first project developed using Unreal Engine, showcasing my initial foray into game development. It is a simple yet engaging "throw the ball" game where the player has a limited number of bullets (20) in each round to achieve the highest score possible.

## Gameplay
The game mechanics are straightforward: the player takes control of a character who can throw balls at various objects within a warehouse environment. The objective is to strategically aim and throw the balls to cause maximum destruction and rack up points. With only 20 bullets per round, players must carefully consider their throws to optimize their score.

## Development
The project leverages Unreal Engine's powerful Blueprint visual scripting system, which allows for rapid prototyping and iteration without the need for extensive coding knowledge. By utilizing Blueprints, I was able to create interactive gameplay elements, define object behaviors, and implement scoring and round management systems.

Throughout the development process, I followed the course "Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games" on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/). The course provided a solid foundation in Unreal Engine development and guided me in creating this project from scratch.

## Learning Outcomes
While WarehouseWreckage serves as a stepping stone in my journey as a game developer, it demonstrates my ability to grasp fundamental concepts, work with Unreal Engine's tools and workflows, and deliver a functional and entertaining game experience.
